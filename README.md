# Retro Text Engine

Do you want to create a beautiful triple-A-quality game with state-of-the-art graphics? Then this absolutely isn't the engine for that!

However, this engine is still super cool and useful!

Retro Text Engine's focus is on allowing you, the writer, to create your very own bespoke choose-your-own adventure game without ANY knowledge of programming! (Well, except how to build the project, but once I've prepared a release it'll be simple as opening an .exe). Anyway, the point is:

You can just write a pretty mechanically deep choose-your-own adventure game!

## What makes Retro Text Engine different

Aside from it running exclusively in console (though you're free to fork it and wrap it in a pretty GUI, that'd be super cool) and therefore being peak nostalgia and vintage aesthetic, you, the writer, are given some immediately-accessible tools:

* Inventory

* Equipment

* Combat

* Enemy customisation

* Stat checks in dialogue

* Auto-save and auto-load of player's character data

* Audio playback (includes some stock tunes composed by yours truly, too!)

etc! Each of these aspects, too, can be configured by editing a corresponding .txt file!

If you're a programmer, the entirety of the engine is built using only packages that come bundled with IntelliJ, no downloading and adding extra packages

So, if you want branching story lines, a sense of progression for the player through levelling up and customising their character, a customisable inventory and equipment system - Retro Text Engine's up to the task!


## Getting started

If you're looking for resources on how to use the engine, best head over to [my wiki page](https://github.com/quad-indent/retro-text-engine/wiki)!

Also, head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/quad-indent/retro-text-engine/releases), download the latest release, unzip it, and begin editing! To launch your project, simply launch oldtimey_rpg_engine.exe!

## Acknowledgements

Many, many thanks to [Boann](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26227947) over at Stack Overflow for their class that I incorporated into the engine, that makes it infinitely easier to compute equations that are passed as a String
